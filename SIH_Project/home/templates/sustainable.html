    <h2>Introduction to Sustainable Agriculture in India</h2>
    
    <div class="intro-content">
        <div class="context">
            <h3>Context</h3>
            <p>Sustainable agriculture is crucial in India due to several unique challenges faced by farmers. One major issue is the prevalence of small landholdings, which limits the ability to implement large-scale farming practices and achieve economies of scale. Many farmers also rely heavily on monsoon rains, making them vulnerable to the variability of weather patterns. Additionally, soil degradation is a growing concern, with practices such as overuse of chemical fertilizers and monoculture contributing to declining soil health.</p>
            <p>By addressing these challenges, sustainable agriculture offers a path forward that aligns with both environmental and economic goals, helping farmers adapt to changing conditions and maintain their livelihoods.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="importance">
            <h3>Importance</h3>
            <p>Implementing sustainable practices can significantly benefit Indian farmers. Firstly, it can increase productivity by improving soil health and water efficiency, leading to better crop yields. Techniques such as crop rotation and organic farming contribute to a more balanced ecosystem, which can enhance crop resilience and reduce dependency on expensive chemical inputs.</p>
            <p>Secondly, sustainable agriculture helps reduce input costs by minimizing the need for chemical fertilizers and pesticides, as well as optimizing water use. This is particularly important for smallholder farmers who often face financial constraints.</p>
            <p>Finally, adopting sustainable practices ensures long-term soil health, which is essential for the continued productivity of the land. Healthy soils support better water retention, reduce erosion, and contribute to a more stable agricultural environment.</p>

        <section id="practices">
            <h2>Key Sustainable Practices for Indian Farmers</h2>
            
            <div class="practice">
                <h3>Crop Diversification</h3>
                <p>Crop diversification involves growing a variety of crops rather than relying on a single crop. This includes practices such as mixed cropping (growing different crops together), intercropping (planting complementary crops in the same field), and crop rotation (changing crops from season to season). These practices improve soil fertility, reduce pest and disease risks, and enhance overall farm productivity.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="practice">
                <h3>Organic Farming</h3>
                <p>Organic farming focuses on using natural methods to grow crops. Benefits include reducing reliance on synthetic fertilizers and pesticides. Farmers can use locally available organic fertilizers like compost and vermicompost, and natural pest control products such as neem-based pesticides. Organic farming improves soil health, increases biodiversity, and produces healthier food.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="practice">
                <h3>Water Management</h3>
                <p>Efficient water management is crucial, especially in drought-prone areas. Techniques such as drip irrigation, which delivers water directly to the plant roots, and rainwater harvesting, which captures and stores rainwater for future use, can significantly reduce water usage. Proper irrigation practices and soil moisture management ensure that crops receive the right amount of water without wastage.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="practice">
                <h3>Soil Health Management</h3>
                <p>Maintaining soil health is essential for sustainable agriculture. Practices like using green manure (cover crops that improve soil fertility), cover cropping (planting crops to cover and protect the soil), and reduced tillage (minimizing soil disturbance) help preserve soil structure, prevent erosion, and enhance soil nutrient content.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="practice">
                <h3>Agroforestry</h3>
                <p>Agroforestry involves integrating trees and shrubs into crop and livestock systems. This practice enhances biodiversity, improves soil health, and provides additional income through timber, fruits, nuts, or other products. Trees can also act as windbreaks and improve water retention in the soil.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="practice">
                <h3>Integrated Pest Management (IPM)</h3>
                <p>IPM is a holistic approach to pest control that reduces the reliance on chemical pesticides. It includes using natural pest control methods such as biopesticides (natural or biologically derived pesticides), pheromone traps (to attract and trap pests), and beneficial insects (like ladybugs that prey on harmful pests). IPM helps manage pest populations while minimizing environmental impact.</p>

                <div class="story">
                    <h4>Ravi Kumar's Transformation in Punjab</h4>
                    <p>Ravi Kumar, a farmer from Punjab, adopted sustainable farming practices by integrating crop diversification and organic inputs into his farming. He replaced chemical fertilizers with compost and introduced crop rotation, which significantly improved soil fertility. As a result, his crop yields increased by 30%, and his income grew by 25% in just two years. Ravi's farm has become a model for neighboring farms, promoting community welfare through workshops and sharing his knowledge.</p>

                <div class="story">
                    <h4>Priya Sharma's Journey with Organic Farming in Uttarakhand</h4>
                    <p>Priya Sharma transitioned to organic farming on her family’s farm in Uttarakhand. By using organic fertilizers like vermicompost and neem-based pesticides, she enhanced soil health and increased crop resilience. Her farm's productivity rose by 20%, and she was able to command higher prices for her organic produce. Priya's success story has inspired many local farmers to explore organic farming, leading to a broader movement towards sustainable agriculture in her region.</p>

                <div class="practice">
                    <h4>System of Rice Intensification (SRI) in Tamil Nadu</h4>
                    <p>Farmers in Tamil Nadu have successfully implemented the System of Rice Intensification (SRI), which involves planting rice in a way that optimizes water, nutrients, and space. By using fewer seeds and providing better spacing and water management, SRI has increased rice yields by up to 50%. This practice has also reduced water usage by 30%, making it an effective method for improving productivity and sustainability in rice cultivation.</p>

                <div class="practice">
                    <h4>Zero Budget Natural Farming (ZBNF) in Andhra Pradesh</h4>
                    <p>In Andhra Pradesh, Zero Budget Natural Farming (ZBNF) has revolutionized agriculture by focusing on cost-free, natural farming techniques. By using locally available resources like cow dung, cow urine, and natural pesticides, ZBNF has reduced the cost of farming inputs dramatically. Farmers practicing ZBNF have reported significant improvements in soil health and crop yields, as well as increased income due to lower production costs and higher market prices for their produce.</p>
